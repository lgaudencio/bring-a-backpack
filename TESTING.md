## Accessibility 

The [Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool was used throughout development and for final testing of the deployed website to check for any aid accessibility testing. 

Testing was conducted to ensure that the following criteria points were met:

* All forms have associated labels or aria-labels so that this is read out on a screen reader to users who tab to form inputs

* Colour contrasts on the site meet a minimum ratio this is specified on the [WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)

* Headings levels are not missed or skipped, this is to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the user

* All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, this will allow the user to navigate by page regions

* All HTML pages have a lang attribute set

* Aria properties have been implemented correctly 

* WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices have been followed

## Validator Testing

All pages were run through the W3 HTML Validator. Initially, some error were flagged due to double ending p tags because the RichTextFields were wrapped with p tags. All of these issues were corrected and all pages passed validation. 

Due to the Django templating language code used in the HTML files, it could not just be copied and pasted into the validator and due to the secured views snd pages with login required cannot be validated by direct URL. To test the validation of the files, the webpage must be opened, right click and view page source. Paste te raw HTML code into the validator as this will be only the HTML rendered code. 

![Image for HTML validator](docs/readme_images/html-validator.png)

All pages were run through a PEP8 validator to ensure all code was PEP8 compliant. Initially, some errors were flagged due to trailing white space, lines too long and 1 line instead of 2 expected. All these errors were corrected and the code passed through the validator with no issues. There was however one exception, which was the settings.py file. 

The Django auto generated code for AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS and the STATICFILES_STORAGE for cloudinary ere showing up as too long. I could not find a way to split these lines but since they were auto generated and not my own custom code, I hope this is acceptable.

The JavaScript code used was run through JSHINT JavaScript validator. The only issues it raised was missing semicolons, which were corrected. The only warning that remained was regarding ES6.

## Lighthouse Report

The lighthouse report gave a score of 93, 100, 100, 100.

## Responsiveness

During the styling phase for media queries, all pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes from 280px and upwards. All pages were tested on Chrome, Safari and Edge browsers.

Steps to test:

* Open a browser and go to [website](https://bring-a-backpack-7f3c85a6ca8a.herokuapp.com/)
* Right click on the page and select 'Inspect', this will open up developer tools.
* Decrease the screen size to 280px.
* Click and drag the responsive window to set the width for testing.

Expected:

Website is to be responsive on all screen sizes and no images/logos are to be pixelated or distorted due to stretching. No horizontal scroll appears on mobile devices and nothing overlaps.

Actual:

Website behaved as expected.

The website was tested for its responsiveness on the following devices and no issues were observed:

* Samsung Galaxy Fold
* iPad Air
* Surface Pro 7
* Nexus 10
