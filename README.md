## User Experience Design

### The Strategy Plane

#### Site Goals

The site is aimed at all travel enthusiasts who are planning their next adventure and would like a source of inspiration from other fellow travellers. Site users can sign up, login, create a destination review and the published reviews can be easily edited or even deleted. Users can also share their photography skills but creating posts with 10 images, just like the destination reviews, these posts can be edited and deleted when needed. Additionally, users have their own profiles, it will show other users their recent reviews/posts. The profile can also be edited, such as info and the display picture. 

#### Agile Planning 

This project was developed using agile methodologies, delivering small features at a time. All projects were assigned to epics, prioritised under labels - Must have, Should have and Could have. The core project requirements were given the ‘Must have’ label to ensure they were prioritised and completed before moving onto the requirements that had the other two labels. 

The Kanban board was created using Github projects and can be seen here and can be viewed to see more information on the project cards. Most stories will have acceptance criteria to define its function, once the function has been met, it is then marked off as completed. 

##### Epics

The project had 8 main Epics (milestones):

**EPIC 1 – Base Setup**
 
The base setup epic is for all stories needed for the base set up of the application. Without the base setup, the app would not be possible, therefore it was the first epic to be delivered as all other features will depend on the completion of the base setup. 
 
**EPIC 2 – Authentication**
 
The authentication epic is for all stories that are related to the sign up, login and authorisation of views. Authorisation provides crucial and critical functionality, as without it, users would not be able to make a destination review and/or a photography post securely without the threat of other site users being able to edit or delete their review and/or photos.
 
**EPIC 3 – Destinations**
 
The destinations epic is for all stories that relate to creating, viewing, editing and deleting a destination review. This allows site visitors to view all destination reviews and it allows registered users to manage their own reviews by using a simple to use user interface.

**EPIC 4 - Profiles**

The profiles epic is for all stories relating to creating and editing a profile. This allows all signed up users to be able to create their own profiles and edit them as they wish. Users can add such things as, a name, display picture, nationality, type of traveller and a bio. 

**EPIC 5 - Photography** 

The destinations epic is for all stories that relate to creating, viewing, editing and deleting a photography post. This allows site visitors to view all photography posts and it allows registered users to manage their own posts by using a simple to use user interface.

**EPIC 6 - Stand alone pages**

The stand alone pages epic is for small pages that did not have enough stories to warrant their own full epics. Therefore, these small deliverables were added under this one epic. 

**EPIC 7 - Deployment**

This epic is relating to the deployment of the app to heroku so that the site can be made live for all users.

**EPIC 8 - Documentation**

This epic is relating to all document related stories and tasks that are needed to document the software development lifecycle of the application. It aims to deliver quality documentation, explains all stages of development and necessary information on running, deploying and using the application.
