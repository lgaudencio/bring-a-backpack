## User Experience Design

### The Strategy Plane

#### Site Goals

The site is aimed at all travel enthusiasts who are planning their next adventure and would like a source of inspiration from other fellow travellers. Site users can sign up, login, create a destination review and the published reviews can be easily edited or even deleted. Users can also share their photography skills but creating posts with 10 images, just like the destination reviews, these posts can be edited and deleted when needed. Additionally, users have their own profiles, it will show other users their recent reviews/posts. The profile can also be edited, such as info and the display picture. 

#### Agile Planning 

This project was developed using agile methodologies, delivering small features at a time. All projects were assigned to epics, prioritised under labels - Must have, Should have and Could have. The core project requirements were given the ‘Must have’ label to ensure they were prioritised and completed before moving onto the requirements that had the other two labels. 

The Kanban board was created using Github projects and can be seen here and can be viewed to see more information on the project cards. Most stories will have acceptance criteria to define its function, once the function has been met, it is then marked off as completed.
